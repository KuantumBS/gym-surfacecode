###  gym_surfacecode

A surface code environment aimed at facilitating the development of decoders (decoding agents) for fault tolerant quantum computing.

The environment provided here was previously used for the development of <a href="https://github.com/R-Sweke/DeepQ-Decoding"> deepQ decoders</a> . To get started, and for an introduction to fault-tolerant quantum computing, and particularly the surface code, we highly suggest reading the associated manuscript <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07207.pdf">Reinforcement Learning Decoders for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</a>.

Additionally, if you use this environment, or any of the code provided here, please cite above work as follows:

#### 0) Quickstart

In this readme, we will provide a summary and walkthrough of all the information contained within the included notebooks. However, we recommend starting by reading the included manuscript <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07207.pdf">Reinforcement Learning Decoders for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</a>. To explore the code used for training and evaluating agents, as well as take a more detailed look at the results, please see the example notebooks. In order to run the code given in these notebooks the following is required:

<ol>
  <li> <b>Python 3</b> (with numpy and scipy)</li>
  <li> <b>Jupyter</b> </li>
  <li> <b>tensorflow</b> </li>
  <li> <b>keras</b> </li> 
  <li> <b>gym</b> </li> 
  <li> a modified <b>keras-rl</b>, installed from <a href="https://github.com/R-Sweke/keras-rl">this fork</a> </li>
</ol> 

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact any of the contributors.

Enjoy!
